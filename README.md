Explain how it supports collaborative software development.It allows you to create, store, change, merge, and collaborate on files and code.Its pull request system allows developers to propose changes, discuss modifications, and review code before merging.eam administration · Organizations · Invitations · Teams · Team sync · Custom roles · Custom repository roles · Domain verification · Verified and approved ...
Repositories on GitHub:

What is a GitHub repository? Describe how to create a new repository and the essential elements that should be included in it.It's a place where you can store your code, your files, and each file's revision history. Create a new folder for your project.
Open the folder in Git BASH.

Branching and Merging in GitHub:

What are branches in GitHub, and why are they important? Describe the process of creating a branch, making changes, and merging it back into the main branch.Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository.Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes.To merge branches locally, use git checkout to switch to the branch you want to merge into. This branch is typically the main branch. Next, use git merge and specify the name of the other branch to bring into this branch
Pull Requests and Code Reviews:

What is a pull request in GitHub, and how does it facilitate code reviews and collaboration? Outline the steps to create and review a pull request.Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.GitHub's pull request system encourages a culture of peer review and collaborative coding. It ensures code quality and fosters knowledge sharing among team members.
GitHub Actions:

Explain what GitHub Actions are and how they can be used to automate workflows. Provide an example of a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.CI/CD: Use GitLab CI/CD to commit all code, build and run the required tests. Deploy code to UAT: Configure GitLab CI/CD to deploy code to the UAT server. Deploy to production: Repeat the CI/CD step to deploy code to UAT.
Introduction to Visual Studio:

What is Visual Studio, and what are its key features? How does it differ from Visual Studio Code?Visual Studio is a powerful developer tool that you can use to complete the entire development cycle in one place. It is a comprehensive integrated development environment (IDE) that you can use to write, edit, debug, and build code, and then deploy your app.IS to write high-quality code with comprehensive testing tools to aid in the development of applications.The main difference between Visual Studio vs Visual Studio Code is that the first one is a comprehensive Integrated Development Environment (IDE) tool for software development, while the second one is an Extension-based Code Editor. It only needs a little space to run.
Integrating GitHub with Visual Studio:

Describe the steps to integrate a GitHub repository with Visual Studio. If you are not redirected to VS Code, you can add your authorization token manually. ...
From the GitHub repository dropdown you can filter and pick the repository you want to clone locally.
Authenticating with an existing repository.
.
Authenticating with an existing repository.

Debugging in Visual Studio:

Explain the debugging tools available in Visual Studio. How can developers use these tools to identify and fix issues in their code?A debugger is a very specialized developer tool that attaches to your running app and allows you to inspect your code.Debuggers are invaluable tools that allow developers to step through their code, inspect variables, and track program execution in real-time.
Collaborative Development using GitHub and Visual Studio:

Discuss how GitHub and Visual Studio can be used together to support collaborative development. Provide a real-world example of a project that benefits from this integration.GitHub is a cloud-based service for storing and sharing source code. Using GitHub with Visual Studio Code lets you share your source code and collaborate with others right within your editor. Sync contacts between database.
